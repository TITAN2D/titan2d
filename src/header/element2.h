//! The Element class is a data structure designed to hold all the information need for an h (cell edge length) p (polynomial order) adaptive finite element.  Titan doesn't use p adaptation because it is a finite difference/volume code, hence many of the members are legacy from afeapi (adaptive finite element application programmers interface) which serves as the core of titan.  There is a seperate Discontinuous Galerkin Method (finite elements + finite volumes) version of titan and the polynomial information is not legacy there.  However in this version of Titan elements function simply as finite volume cells.

The state variables (used to compute the physical fluxes) at the element/cell edge are adjusted to be the weighted by wetness average over an element/cell edge.  As such physical fluxes through completely dry edges of partially wet elements/cells are zeroed, while physical fluxes through completely wet edges are left unchanged.  Because of the definition as "wetness weighted average" physical fluxes through a partially wet edge shared with a neighbor of the same generation is also left left unchanged but, when a partially wet edge is shared with two more refined neighbors the total mass and momentum at the edge is split between the two neighbors in proportion to how much of their boundary shared with this element is wet.  This "scaling" of the physical fluxes is the "adjustment of fluxes in partially wetted cells" facet of our multifaceted thin-layer problem mitigation approach.  And it has been shown to significantly reduce the area covered by a thin layer of material.  Keith wrote this May 2007.

//! The ElemPtrList class is basically just a "smart array" of pointers to Elements, by smart I mean it keeps track of its size and number of Elements in the list and expands/reallocates itself whenever you add an element ptr to the list when you've run out of space, it also keeps a record of the index of the first "new" element pointer you've added in the current series, which is useful for the intended purpose... ElemList was designed for use in refinement and unrefinement to replace fixed sized arrays (length=297200) of pointers to Elements.  The reason for this upgrade was it was causing valgrind to issue all kinds of warnings about the "client switching stacks" and "invalid write/read of size blah blah blah" because the stacksize was too large.  My 20061121 rewrite of hadapt.C and unrefine.C to make them "fast" caused this problem because I added a second (large) fixed sized array to both of them so I could reduce the number of hashtable scans by only revisiting the "new" additions to the array of pointers of Elements. --Keith wrote this on 20061124, i.e. the day after Thanksgiving, and I'm very thankful for having the inspiration to figure out the cause of valgrid warning
