Major work was done on implementing new interfaces, optimizing and refractoring code, addition of new methods.

 * New python interface and titan execution scheme.
   * Titan-2D uses python script as input now
   * no more preprocessing and executable copying

 * Code optimizations
   * Hybrid OpenMP/MPI scheme
   * More than x9 improvement in serial and OpenMP executions
   * MPI was not optimized yet therefore OpenMP is parallelization method for now
   
 * New methods and capabilities
   * Voellmy-Salm, Pouliquen-Forterre and TwoPhases-Pitman-Le methods were added in addition to Coulomb method
   * Restarting capabilities were restored and it uses HDF5 format. Restart files are viewable through Paraview
     allowing visualization majority of internal variables
     
 * GUI
   * Java based GUI
