<h1>Run Parameters</h1>

<h2>Maximum Number of Time Steps</h2>
The integer value can be entered in this text field.
A maximum number of time steps that the simulation will run.
For most simulations, this should be in the 1,000s range.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Maximum Time</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
The maximum amount of time that the simulation will approximate.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Computational Cells Across Smallest Pile/Flux-Source Diameter </h2>
The integer value can be entered in this text field.  It is used by Titan to
determine the maximum level of grid-cell refinement allowed throughout the
simulation.  The default value is 20, meaning that the dimensions of the smallest
cell size on the map will correspond to a length that is at most 1/20th that of
the smallest pile or flux-source diameter - that is, 1/20th of the smallest value
entered in the ``Major and Minor Extent, majorR, minorR (m,m)'' field on the
Pile or Flux-Source Information Forms.  When an adaptive grid is selected, only
a small portion of the total map area will be maximally refined; without
adaptation however, the entire map will consist of maximally refined cells -
which, if small, can be computationally expensive.  The field cannot be left
blank.

<h2>AMR</h2>
Activate the "True" button to enable adaptive mesh refinement during the simulation.

<h2>Order Method</h2>
Activate the "Second" button to assume a linear variation (instead of constant
values) of the conserved quantities (pile height, momentum) across each cell.
The second order method should give more accurate results but increases
computation time and is less stable.

<h2>Scale Parameters</h2>

<h3>Scale Simulation</h3>
Activate the "True" button to scale the governing equations by the pile height,
a length scale and a gravity scale.  The pile height scale is taken as the
cubed root of the total volume of material to appear on the map.  Thus, the
scaled simulation calculates the pile height as a fraction of this value.  The
gravity scale is 9.80 ms^-2.

<h3>Scale Length</h3>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.  It is used by Titan to
correspond to the expected runout length of the flow.  The field  is only
requiredfieldif the simulation is scaled.  If the simulation is scaled, the field
cannot be left blank.

<h2>Stat Props</h2>

<h3>Height used to define flow outline</h3>
The decimal value, in meters (> 0), can be entered in this text field.
Used to set the "boundary" of the mass flow.    The user is required to enter
a greater than zero height, which will be used to, among other things, compute
the spread of the pile in the x and y directions.
The field can be left blank defaulting to $\frac{1}{50}{\rm th}$ of the
maximum initial pile height.

<h3>Flow Height Test</h3>
Set the criteria to determine if the flow reaches a particular Depth (for the
location as specified by the flow height x and y location).

<h3>Flow Height Depth</h3>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Flow depth to test for (at the given location).
The field can be left blank indicating ...

<h3>Flow Height Test Point X Location</h3>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
X location to test for specified flow depth.
The field can be left blank indicating ...

<h3>Flow Height Test Point Y Location</h3>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Y location to test for specified flow depth.
The field can be left blank indicating ...
