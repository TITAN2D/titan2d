<h1>Material Model and Map</h1>

<h2>Use Material Map</h2>
The use of material maps is currently disabled.
<b>NOTE :</b> The next feature is available only to users who have a specific material
map (file ends in _Mat)*.  The Use GIS Material Map check box enables the
input of a GIS-based surfacial material map that matches the area covered by
the DEM.  This map is used to define the zones in the region where changes in
the surface morphology results in a change in the basal friction angle.  When
this function is enabled, pop-up windows (appearing after the ``run'' button is
clicked) will ask for the internal and basal friction angles for each material
represented on the material map.

<h2>Material Model</h2>

<h3>Physics Model</h3>
Select the moving material model for the simulation.  Current models available are Coulomb, TwoPhases_Coulomb, Voellmy, Pouliquen and Maeno.  Input fields appear for entering parameters specific for the selected model.
