<h1>Loading and Saving a Titan Model Run</h1>

<h2>Load</h2>
A pre-existing Titan run parameter set can be loaded.  The directory containing
the Titan parameter files can be loaded by either using the directory selector,
which will be displayed by pushing the "Input Directory" button, or by typing
in the fully qualified path in the text field.  Once the directory has been
selected, push the "Load" button to load the paramters for the Titan run.  When
the "Load" button is pushed, the save directory and run name fields on this tab
will be updated automatically.  If the "Load" button is not pushed, the
selected run will not be loaded.

<h2>Save</h2>
A Titan run's parameters can be saved for future use.  Parameter files will
be written containing the Titan parameters in a format that can be read in
the future.  A base directory and run name must be provided to save the
Titan parameters.  The base directory can be set by either using the directory
selector, which will be displayed by pushing the "Base Save Directory" button,
or by typing in the fully qualified path in the test field.  The run name can
be set by typing in the value in the Run Name text field.  The run name will
be appended to the base directory to produce a fully qualified path where the
Titan parameter files will be saved.  Once the base directory and run name have
been entered, push the "Save" button to save the parameters for the Titan run.
When the "Save" button is pushed, the input directory on this tabe will be
updated automatically.  If the "Save" button is not pushed, the selected run
will not be saved.

<h2>Email Address</h2>
The string value can be entered in this text field.
The email address to send the notification of completion for the run to.
An email address is not needed if you are doing the run on a PC.
