<h1>Job Monitor</h1>
Displays information about Titan model runs submitted by the user.  It does
not display any model run information for jobs submitted by other users.
When the tab is initially displayed, it may take a moment to display the
job information.  The job status displayed is updated every 2 minutes.
The job information(not including the status) is retrieved
from a database.  The job status is determined dynamically.
Each user will have a ".titan" directory in their home
directory.  The database (which is a directory structure of files) is stored
there.  Should the ".titan" directory be removed, all job details will be
lost.  The job itself would not be affected.
