<h1>Flux Sources</h1>

<h2>Extrusion Rate</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
The rate at which material extrudes vertically from the ground.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Active Time Start</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Specify a starting time for the flux source that can encompass either part or all of the simulation.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Active Time End</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Specify a ending time for the flux source.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Center of Source X</h2>
The decimal value, in UTM coordinates, can be entered in this text field.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Center of Source Y</h2>
The decimal value, in UTM coordinates, can be entered in this text field.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Major Extent</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Required because the flux source is elliptically shaped.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Minor Extent</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
Required because the flux source is elliptically shaped.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Orientation Angle</h2>
The decimal value, in degrees from X axis to major axis, can be entered in
this text field.
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Initial Speed</h2>
The decimal value can be entered in this text field.
The initial horizontal speed (i.e. tangential to the terrain) of the material
as it leaves the flux-source (the flux-source itself, remains stationary).
The field cannot be left blank.

<h2>Initial Direction</h2>
The decimal value, measured in degrees from the X axis, can be entered in this
text field.  The field cannot be left blank.
