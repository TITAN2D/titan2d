<h1>Piles</h1>

<h2>Type</h2>
Select 1 for Paraboloid.  Select 2 for Cylinder.
This field cannot be left blank.

When Paraboloid is selected, the geometry for each pile is a paraboloid given by:<br>
P*(1-((x-xc)/xr)^2 -((y-yc)/yr)^2) (assuming an orientation angle of zero)
(a negative pile height calculated from this equation will be set to zero).<br>
These equations are for the non-scaled pile.  If two or more piles overlap, the
highest height of the pile is used as the pile height at that point.<br>
NOTE : The X-axis is defines as UTM E and the Y-axis is defines as UTM N.
