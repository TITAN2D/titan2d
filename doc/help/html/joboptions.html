<h1>Output Options</h1>

<h2>Overwrite Output</h2>
Results overwrite safety flag.  If set to False, aborts simulation if output files with same names exist in the current working directory.  If set to True, overwrite previous output.

<h2>Restart Output</h2>

<h3>Time Between Results Output</h3>
The decimal value, in seconds, can be entered in this text field.

<h3>Time Between Saves</h3>
The decimal value, in seconds, can be entered in this text field.

<h3>Keep All</h3>
Keep all restart files.  If set to False, keep only the last restart file.

<h3>Keep Redundant Data</h3>
Keep redundant data.

<h2>Time Series Output</h2>

<h3>Visualization Output Types</h3>
Choose Formats (tecplotxxxx.plt, mshplotxxxx.plt, GMFG Viz, XDMF/Paraview,
Web Viz, or grass_sites) - Activate the buttons corresponding to the
visualization outputs that are desired.  tecplotxxxx.plt and mshplotxxxx.plt
are tecplot files. GMFG Viz is for the TITAN2D visualizer.
XDMF/Paraview is the paraview visualization application.
Web Viz is for the web visualization output.  Note that the user can have
multiple visualization output formats with each simulation run.


<h3>Time Between Results Output</h3>
The decimal value, in seconds, can be entered in this text field.
This corresponds to how often results will be saved to file for later analysis.
These files can become very large and the user may not need to see results for
every time step since some time steps may have little change in the results from
the previous time step.  For example, a user may wish to only save a timestep
every 5 seconds of simulated time.  If desired, the user may choose to use a
fraction of a second.  The field cannot be left blank.

<h3>Time Between Saves</h3>
The decimal value, in seconds, can be entered in this text field.
Specify the frequency at which the configuration of the simulation is saved to
a restart0000.x file.  To continue a given simulation, rename the most recent
restart0000.x file to restart0000.this and run titan again as usual. (Note
that additional restart0001.x, restart0002.x, etc. files will exist - and will
also have to be renamed - for multi-processor runs).
The field cannot be left blank.
